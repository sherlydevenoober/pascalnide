/**
 * The classes in this package take advantage of the fact that the VM does
 * not attempt to load a class until it's accessed, and the verifier
 * does not run until a class is loaded.  By keeping the methods which
 * are unavailable on older platforms in subclasses which are only ever
 * accessed on platforms where they are available, we can preserve
 * compatibility with older platforms without resorting to reflection.
 * <p>
 * See http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/backward-compatibility.html
